An important focus of our group is _multivariate complexity_ analysis and algorithm design, a.k.a. _parameterized complexity_. The basic insight is that in many situations, one or more secondary measurements of problem instances or computational objectives, beyond the overall input size, govern a problem's computational complexity.
