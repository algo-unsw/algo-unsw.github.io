> In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.

The algorithms group brings together academics at [UNSW](http://www.unsw.edu.au) with research interests in algorithms and complexity. It is hosted by the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering">school of computer science and engineering</a> and includes external members from the [school of mathematics and statistics](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/maths).


Algorithms are at the heart of all information processing. We design and analyse algorithms in terms of resource requirements (time, space, randomness) and we study their limitations. Research in this field emphasizes mathematical technique and rigor.
